# Front-End Self-Assessment

## Architecture & Modularity

- The codebase is well-structured with modular React components such as `login` `Marketplace`, `BookingSchedule`, `CalendarHeader`, `UserReservations`, and `RoomSelector`.

- Props are passed cleanly, maintaining separation of concerns and enabling reusability.

- Naming conventions are semantic and consistent, improving readability and maintainability.
- Strong architectural foundation with scalable component design.

## Styling & Responsiveness

- CSS uses flexbox, media queries, and alternating row styles to create a responsive and polished UI.

- Visual hierarchy is clear, with thoughtful use of color contrast and spacing.

- Button states are visually distinct, though accessibility could be improved with ARIA attributes and keyboard support.

- Visually refined and responsive. Accessibility enhancements would elevate the experience.

## Routing & Navigation

- React Router is implemented effectively, with routes for /booking, /login, /register, and /marketplace.

- Navigation logic is intuitive, including calendar reset on tab switch and disabled navigation before today.

- Routing errors (e.g. “No routes matched location '/'”) were correctly diagnosed and resolved.

- Routing is robust and user-friendly, with thoughtful UX logic.

## Forms & State Management

- Registration and login forms are implemented with basic validation.

- State management using useState is clean and effective for handling date, tab, room, and reservation logic.

- Booking logic includes duplicate prevention, reservation limits, and dynamic time formatting.

- Smart use of React state and form logic. Ready for deeper validation and persistence.

## Testing & Real-World Readiness

- Manual testing is thorough, with Postman used for backend validation.

- Edge cases like booking limits and disabled buttons are handled gracefully.

- Next steps include adding unit tests, form libraries, and accessibility audits.

- Real world ready with thoughtful logic and clean UX. Testing and polish will complete the picture.
